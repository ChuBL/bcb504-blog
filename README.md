## Issues
<del>I have tried to rename the upper left button's text from My_first_blog while resulted in vain. 

<del>The attribute of `website: title` in `_quarto.yml` seems has nothing to do with the text in that button.

Well, the actual issue is that no change has been made, no matter how many times I edit the `.qmd` file and hit the render button. I fixed this issue by manually closing all the file tabs in my Rstudio and then rendering the `index.qmd` for one more time.

I believe there are some background sessions hidden behind the Rstudio ui. I think that's why Rstudio and R language are not my favorite coding options.
